This reference set is a list of binary names of network packet capturing software. The reference set has been pre-populated with names of some common network protocol analysis software filenames.

Background:
  Packet capturing programs can allow a user to capture and examine traffic on a network. If these programs don't have adequate internal access controls, users may use them to learn information they might otherwise not have access to.

  In addition, these programs sometimes carry a risk of exploitation.

   Third Party References :
       http://sectools.org/tag/sniffers/?sort=release

Remedy :
   Examine the addresses and users involved. Ensure those systems are authorized to engage in packet capturing for administrative purposes.

   Refer to packet capture program's vendor documentation for patch, upgrade or suggested workaround information to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

Detection notes and modification:
   The scope of this rule can be modified by adding or removing binary names for packet capturing tools to ""UBA : Network Capture, Monitoring and Analysis Program Filenames""
